# Kappa vs Lambda Architecture.

- Data processing architectures like Lambda and Kappa help businesses analyze and extract valuable insights from their data in real-time.
- Lambda architecture uses separate batch and stream processing systems, making it scalable and fault-tolerant but complex to set up and maintain (as it duplicates processing logic).
- Kappa architecture simplifies the pipeline with a single stream processing system as it treats all data as streams, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance, but requires experience in stream processing and distributed systems.
- Lambda architecture is well-suited when companies have mixed requirements for stream and batch processing, e.g., for real-time analytics and multiple batch processing tasks or data lakes, while Kappa architecture is ideal for continuous data pipelines, real-time data processing, and IoT systems.
- Businesses should consider their specific data processing needs and choose an architecture that aligns with their goals and requirements.
